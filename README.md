# Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science

This is the git repository for a book in preparation for an introductory undergraduate course on computer science.
The book is posted (in both html and pdf formats)  on the web page [http://introtcs.org](http://introtcs.org)

Please use the [issues](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/pulls) to post any suggestions, comments, typo fixes, etc..

I am working on improving this text during the summer of 2018. My main priorities are:

* Add explanations, proof ideas, examples.

* Add exercises

* Emphasize the "non importance" of the choice of particular models (NAND vs circuits, NAND-TM/NAND<< vs Turing machines/ RAM machines).

* Write two chapters: space bounded computation and proofs and programs.
