#  Algorithms and society

PLAN: Talk about how algorithms interact with society - incentivies, privacy, fairness. Maybe talk about cryptocurrencies (if we don't talk about it in crypto)


## Lecture summary


## Exercises

::: {.remark title="Disclaimer" #disclaimerrem}
Most of the exercises have been written in the summer of 2018 and haven't yet been fully debugged. While I would prefer people do not post online solutions to the exercises, I would greatly appreciate if you let me know of any bugs. You can do so by posting a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/issues) about the exercise, and optionally complement this with an email to me with more details about the attempted solution.
