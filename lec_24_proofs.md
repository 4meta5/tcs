#  Proofs and algorithms

>_"Let's not try to define knowledge, but try to define zero-knowledge."_, Shafi Goldwasser.


_Proofs_ have captured human imagination for thousands of years, ever since the publication of Euclid's _Elements_, a book second only to the bible in the number of editions printed.

Plan:

* Proofs and algorithms

* Interactive proofs

* Zero knowledge proofs

* Propositions as types, Coq and other proof assistants.

## Exercises

::: {.remark title="Disclaimer" #disclaimerrem}
Most of the exercises have been written in the summer of 2018 and haven't yet been fully debugged. While I would prefer people do not post online solutions to the exercises, I would greatly appreciate if you let me know of any bugs. You can do so by posting a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/issues) about the exercise, and optionally complement this with an email to me with more details about the attempted solution.
