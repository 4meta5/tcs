The names of the chapter and section(s) where the typos/bugs/are

Please open a different issue for each chapter, with the chapter name in the title.

Please don't refer to page numbers or even section numbers since they tend to change - section titles are best. Also, please give some context (sentence before/after the issue) to make it easier for me to find it - thanks!
