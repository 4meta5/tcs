#  Advanced hardness reductions (advanced lecture)

PLAN: show NP hardness of the permanent (maybe also mention  Tutte polynomial?), maybe others such as the Dichotmoy theorem. Perhaps assume hardness of unique-SAT, which we will show in the randomness section. Maybe say something about PCP reductions?

## Lecture summary


## Exercises

::: {.remark title="Disclaimer" #disclaimerrem}
Most of the exercises have been written in the summer of 2018 and haven't yet been fully debugged. While I would prefer people do not post online solutions to the exercises, I would greatly appreciate if you let me know of any bugs. You can do so by posting a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/issues) about the exercise, and optionally complement this with an email to me with more details about the attempted solution.
