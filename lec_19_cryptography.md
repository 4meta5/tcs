#  Cryptography

PLAN: Talk about one-time pad, then about getting short keys from pseudorandom generators. Brief sketch of advanced notions (leaving all details to CS 127)

Possibly: add lecture on _algorithms and society_. Could talk about how algorithms' inputs and outputs today are interwoven with society (Google search, predicitve policing, credit scores, adwords auctions, etc...). Talk about mechanism design, differential privacy, fairness, maybe also  distributed computing and  the consensus problem, and tie this into cryptocurrencies ("one cycle one vote"), talk about governance of the latter and "code as law".
