# Suggesting comments or typos

If you see any typo, things that can be explained better, see an error in a proof, can point me out to a good reference, or any other suggestions to make these notes better then I would greatly appreciate hearing about this.

You can either do this by posting on the [issues](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/issues) page, or if it's a very  localized edit (such as a typo fix), you can also simply edit it yourself via a [pull request](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/pulls).

In an issue, please also write your full name so I can acknowledge you properly. If you do a pull request, please also edit the file `acknowledgements.md` to add your name.

_Thank you!_

Boaz
