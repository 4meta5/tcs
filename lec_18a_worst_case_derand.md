#  Derandomization from worst-case assumptions (advanced lecture)

PLAN: Sketch the proof that BPP is in QuasiP if the permenanet is subexponentially hard. Start by showing that an "ultra hard" function implies a generator with one bit expansion. Then talk about how with $t$ disjoint blocks we can get $t$ bit expansion. Then only sketch the NW generator how we can get exponential blowup with non-disjoint blocks.
Next stage is to show how we get from worst-case to average case. Start by showing how we get weak average-case hardness for the permanent, then use without proof the XOR lemma.

## Exercises

::: {.remark title="Disclaimer" #disclaimerrem}
Most of the exercises have been written in the summer of 2018 and haven't yet been fully debugged. While I would prefer people do not post online solutions to the exercises, I would greatly appreciate if you let me know of any bugs. You can do so by posting a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/issues) about the exercise, and optionally complement this with an email to me with more details about the attempted solution.
