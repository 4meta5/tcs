#  Derandomization from worst-case assumptions (advanced lecture)

PLAN: Sketch the proof that BPP is in QuasiP if the permenanet is subexponentially hard. Start by showing that an "ultra hard" function implies a generator with one bit expansion. Then talk about how with $t$ disjoint blocks we can get $t$ bit expansion. Then only sketch the NW generator how we can get exponential blowup with non-disjoint blocks.
Next stage is to show how we get from worst-case to average case. Start by showing how we get weak average-case hardness for the permanent, then use without proof the XOR lemma.
