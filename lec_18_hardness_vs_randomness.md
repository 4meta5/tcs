#  Hardnesss vs. Randomness

PLAN: Derandomization from an average case assumption. Show how to get from one bit stretch to arbitrary stretch. Perhaps state the general theorem that if there is hard-on-average "planted problem" in NP then there is a pseudorandom generator that stretches one bit, and maybe show a proof that this follows from a very particular planted problem such as planted k-COLORING or noisy 3XOR or something along those lines. Use the XOR lemma which will be stated without proof.
