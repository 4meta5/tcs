#  Hardnesss vs. Randomness

PLAN: Derandomization from an average case assumption. Show how to get from one bit stretch to arbitrary stretch. Perhaps state the general theorem that if there is hard-on-average "planted problem" in NP then there is a pseudorandom generator that stretches one bit, and maybe show a proof that this follows from a very particular planted problem such as planted k-COLORING or noisy 3XOR or something along those lines. Use the XOR lemma which will be stated without proof.

## Exercises

::: {.remark title="Disclaimer" #disclaimerrem}
Most of the exercises have been written in the summer of 2018 and haven't yet been fully debugged. While I would prefer people do not post online solutions to the exercises, I would greatly appreciate if you let me know of any bugs. You can do so by posting a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/issues) about the exercise, and optionally complement this with an email to me with more details about the attempted solution.
