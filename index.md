_Work in progress_

These are lecture notes for an introductory undergraduate course on theoretical computer science.
I am using these notes for [Harvard CS 121](http://cs121.boazbarak.org).


You can also download [all lecture notes in a single PDF file](lnotes_book.pdf) (about 500 pages, 10MB).

See [this website](http://nandpl.org) for (a very much work in progress) implementation of the NAND\* programming languages that are used in in these notes.

If you have any comments, suggestions, typo fixes, etc.. I would be very grateful if you post them as an [issue](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/pulls) in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/boazbk/tcs) where I am maintaining the source files for these notes.
